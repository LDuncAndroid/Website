Today we're announcing the Minecraft Archive project, a project which aims to
make it easier to track down mods for old versions of Minecraft. We'll be doing
this by providing a website which agregates links to the official downloads for
mods which are still available from their official sources. For mods which are
no longer available, we will provide our own download links.

The site currently has only a few mods, but we'll be adding more soon.

We also accept contributions. If you have old mods that are no longer
available, or if you just want to help work on the archive, please contact
Forkk or peterix (preferably on Discord, though email works as well).

You can browse the archive [here](https://mcarchive.net).

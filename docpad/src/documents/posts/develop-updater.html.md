Hello!

If you use the develop branch of MultiMC, you may encounter a dialog box like this while trying to update:
```
Couldn't remove file bin/libQt5X11Extras.so.5. Changes were reverted.
See the MultiMC log file for details.
```

The [issue](https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/issues/1206) has been fixed already, but you will have to switch to the stable version and then back to develop to get new updates.

Sorry for the inconvenience :)

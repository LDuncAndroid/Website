We're happy to announce a new version with a bunch of new features and bugfixes - MultiMC 5 Version 0.3!

Some of the changes include:
* An improved instance view,
* Overhauled 1.6+ loading, paving the way for easier Forge/LiteLoader support and new features,
* Better offline mode,
* Improved clarity in some of the dialogs (for example, it's clear when there are no Forge versions available),
* Tooling support (including JProfiler, JVisualVM and MCEdit),
* Screenshot management and uploading,
* Miscellaneous bugfixes.

Many thanks to [@peterixxx](https://twitter.com/peterixxx), [@02JanDal](https://twitter.com/02JanDal) and [Robotbrain](https://twitter.com/skylordelros) for implementing the vast majority of these changes - go give them <small><i class="uk-icon-heart" alt="<3"></i></small>!

You'll also notice a small change on the front page of the website - statistics. We keep track of how many accesses there are to certain files on our servers (like blog feeds, file downloads), and we use those to make the numbers on the front page.

As always, if you encounter bugs, come ask us for help in the [IRC channel](http://webchat.esper.net/?nick=&channels=MultiMC).

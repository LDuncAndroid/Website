We're happy to announce a new version with a bunch of new features and bugfixes - MultiMC 5 Version 0.3!

Some of the changes include:
* An improved instance view,
* Overhauled 1.6+ loading, paving the way for easier Forge/LiteLoader support and new features,
* Better offline mode,
* Improved clarity in some of the dialogs (for example, it's clear when there are no Forge versions available),
* Tooling support (including JProfiler, JVisualVM and MCEdit),
* Screenshot management and uploading,
* Miscellaneous bugfixes.

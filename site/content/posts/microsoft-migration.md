By now you've probably heard the news that Mojang is migrating everyone's Minecraft accounts to Microsoft accounts. The date when Mojang accounts will stop working is around the corner now - it is the 10th of March, 4 days from now.

You can read about it on the [Minecraft website](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/last-call-voluntarily-migrate-java-accounts) and [this page](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/mojang-account-move).

To go through the migration:

- Go to https://www.minecraft.net
- Log in with your Mojang account
- You should see something similar to this:

  </p>
- Click the big green button and follow the instructions.
- If you are unsure about the process, you can also [read the FAQ](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/sections/360011399911-Migration-for-Minecraft-Java-Edition).

Once you migrate your account, you can add the Microsoft account in MultiMC. It should replace the Mojang account.

This is a big update with some new features and a lot of fixed problems. We have moved to a new server and rebuilt the whole infrastructure.

Aside from MultiMC changes, we now have a [MultiMC subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiMC/) and a [MultiMC discord voice/chat server](https://discord.gg/0k2zsXGNHs0fE4Wm) you can join.

[The full changelog is available on github.](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/blob/2c2b960ab4842b527653ec6fb8081412d9b02bae/changelog.md)

### World management

MultiMC can now manage Minecraft worlds in instances.

You can:

* Rename worlds.
* Copy worlds.
* Delete worlds.
* Import from folders and zip files, even if they include multiple worlds.
* Export individual worlds as zip files.
* Import and export also works using mouse drag&drop.

### Time tracking

MultiMC will now track time you spent playing Minecraft for every instance.

## The future

Considering the generally huge gaps between the last releases, the future of MultiMC should focus on:

* Work on things that *you*, the users, consider useful.
* Release soon.
* Release often.
* Integrating the existing code written for the previous big features in a sensible way.

We are in the process of moving the existing suggestions from [github](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher/labels/feature), where they got really messy, to a [much more manageable list on workflowy](https://workflowy.com/s/2EyDMcp7CU).

Once this is complete, we'll post a poll about what should be the focus of future releases. Feel free to review the list(s) and contact us on IRC, reddit, discord or through github issues!

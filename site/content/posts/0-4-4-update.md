Just a few days ago we released version 0.4.4 of MultiMC 5, today we're already on 0.4.5! These two releases are mainly bug fix updates, but also contain a few new features, some of which are listed below.

See [the changelog](https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5/blob/stable/changelog.md#045) for a full list of changes.

### Translations

Thanks to [robotbrain](https://twitter.com/skylordelros), translations are now handled separately. This means they get updated at runtime, without having to update the entire program. If you want to contribute, head over to [our 
instance of weblate](http://weblate.robotbrain.info) and start translating! Feel free to poke us on IRC if you have any questions about how it works.

At the time of writing German and Italian are fully translated, French and Spanish are close to done, and several others are in progress.

### Themes

Since 0.4.0 we shipped two alternative themes with MultiMC. This update includes several new themes, as well as some tweaks to the existing themes. Have some samples!

## Technic

Not related to the new release, but we recently had some discussions with [GenPage](https://twitter.com/Gen_Page) and the [Technic](http://technicpack.net) team, and we got the permission from them to download and install modpacks 
from the Technic Platform, right from within MultiMC! [@peterixxx](https://twitter.com/peterixxx) has already started to work on this feature, take a look at the screenshot below. We're also discussing how we can combine this 
with QuickMods, so: Exciting times ahead!

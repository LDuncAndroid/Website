We're excited to announce that the first official MultiMC 5 release is now available on the [homepage](/)!

Whilst the builds have been stable enough for general use for a while now, we know that having the "stable" label can be important for people's peace of mind, especially around their beloved instances. There's still a few things that we'd like to improve on and add, but we think that all of the core functionality is there. As always, you can track our progress using the [tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/869353).

We'll be keeping an eye on the [IRC channel](http://webchat.esper.net/?nick=&channels=MultiMC) for bug reports, and if anything unexpected pops up we'll be around to fix it.

MultiMC has some awesome people heading the project now in [@Forkk13](https://twitter.com/forkk13), [@peterixxx](https://twitter.com/peterixxx) and [@drayshak](https://twitter.com/drayshak) and we will continue to add features and polish things in the near future. We'd also like to thank the following people for the contributions they've made to the project: Orochimarufan, [@TakSuyu](https://twitter.com/TakSuyu), [Kilobyte](https://twitter.com/Stiepen22), [@02JanDal](https://twitter.com/02JanDal), [Robotbrain](https://twitter.com/skylordelros) and [@Rootbear75](https://twitter.com/rootbear75).

Have fun!
